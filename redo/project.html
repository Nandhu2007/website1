    <p class="ehealth">Emotional well-being is crucial to overall health. Emotionally healthy people have control over their ideas, feelings, and actions. They are capable of dealing with life's difficulties. They have the ability to keep challenges in perspective and recover from failures. They are confident in themselves and in their relationships. Being emotionally healthy does not imply that you are always joyful. It indicates that you are aware of your feelings. Whether they're positive or negative, you can deal with them. People who are emotionally healthy nonetheless experience tension, rage, and despair. They do, however, know how to deal with their unpleasant emotions. They can tell when a situation is too big for them to tackle alone. They also know when to seek medical assistance.</p>

    <p class="mhealth">Mental health is a problem many people face today. It is important to make sure we look after ourselves, because the effects of poor mental health are extremely consequential. It can lead to anxiety/panic disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. All of these outcomes are very harmful for an individual. The effects of mental health, however, can bypass the barriers of emotion. If one is exposed to poor mental health for too long, it can lead to suicidal tendencies. Individuals with a positive mindset on a daily basis find themselves able to overcome their greatest challenges, and never have a day pass where they have to worry about their psychological health. If someone thinks their mental health could possibly lead to serious issues, they should receive help as soon as possible. Eliminating the chance of these problems before they start is essential.</p>
